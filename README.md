## Description
This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Arvato Bertelsmann.

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Customer Segmentation Report: In this section,the unsupervised learning technique is used to identify few characteristics  for company's existing customers compared to the general population of Germany.

2. Supervised Learning Model: In this section, supervised Learning model is used to investigate mailout_train and mailout_test dataset to predict which individuals are most likely to respond to a mailout campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition: After chosing the best model, the results submitted to [kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/t/21e6d45d4c574c7fa2d868f0e8c83140) competition.
